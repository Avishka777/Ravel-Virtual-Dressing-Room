# Ravel Virtual Dressing Room
Our virtual dressing room application provides users with an interactive platform to explore and purchase clothing with advanced customization options. Users can select garments, choose colors, sizes, and quantities, and add them to their cart for easy checkout. The system features account creation and login, enabling users to track orders and manage their preferences.

A unique aspect of this platform is the 3D clothing customization module. Users can fully personalize their garments by:

Changing the color of the item.
Uploading their own images or using pre-set images to print on the clothing.
Adjusting the scale and positioning (X, Y, Z coordinates) of the images on the garment.
Viewing the 3D model in 360 degrees for a comprehensive experience.
The platform combines convenience and creativity, offering a seamless online shopping experience with innovative customization tools.
