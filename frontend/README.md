# Custom Material-UI Theme Overrides

This repository contains overrides to the default Material-UI theme to customize the appearance of components for our project.

# Overview

We needed to customize the Material-UI theme to better align with our project's design requirements. This involved making adjustments to colors, typography, spacing, and other visual properties.

# Changes Made

- Overridden primary and secondary colors to match our brand's color scheme.
- Adjusted typography styles for headings, body text, and buttons.
- Modified spacing and layout properties for improved alignment and visual consistency.

# Customization Approach

We utilized Material-UI's theming system to override default theme values. The overrides were applied either through the `createMuiTheme` function or by directly modifying the theme object.
